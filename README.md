This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

So in order to get the project up and running, you need to do the following:

## `npm install`

## `npm start`

After you install the packages and start the app, it will load. However, if you try to use the UI to fetch posts and / or add posts, it will fail.

You need to set up a next.js and airtable DB connection. The code for connecting up and running the API is found within the `/sever` folder.
